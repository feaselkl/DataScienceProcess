    "# The Data Science Process\n",
    "\n",
    "This is intended to be a follow-up script for my talk entitled [Launching a Data Science Project:  Cleaning is Half the Battle](http://www.catallaxyservices.com/presentations/datascience/).  I will repeat some of the presentation in this notebook, but this notebook is not designed to replace the presentation itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the course of this notebook, we will analyze Data Professional salaries based on the [2018 Data Professionals Salary Survey](https://www.brentozar.com/archive/2018/01/2018-data-professionals-salary-survey-results/).  We will use this data as the centerpiece of an implementation of the [Microsoft Team Data Science Process](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/overview).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Team Data Science Process has five major steps:\n",
    "1. Business Understanding\n",
    "2. Data Processing\n",
    "3. Modeling\n",
    "4. Deployment\n",
    "5. Repeat\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin working, we need to understand the problem.  In our scenario, we work for Data Platform Specialists, a company dedicated to providing DBAs and other data platform professionals with valuable market knowledge. We have come into possession of a survey of data professionals and want to build insights that we can share with our client base.  Our higher-ups want us to analyze this survey and see how we can make good use of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "During initial brainstorming, we might come up with questions like:\n",
    "* How much money does a DBA make?\n",
    "* Which category of DBA (junior, mid-level, senior) does this particular work?\n",
    "* How can we segment the DBAs in our survey?\n",
    "* Is this many hours per week weird?\n",
    "* Which option should I choose as a career path? DBA? Data science? BI?\n",
    "\n",
    "These questions could potentially be interesting, and the specific form of the question will help guide our analysis.  For example, \"how much\" questions typically lead to regression, whereas \"which category\" questions are indicative of a classification problem.  Segmentation questions where we do not know the classes beforehand is a classic example of a clustering problem, and the final two questions are anomaly detection and recommendation, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Narrowing this down with our champion and other stakeholders, we can get to the following question which we will endeavour to answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "**How much money should we expect a data professional will make?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a vague question that we will want to focus in on later, but at least it gives us a start.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three steps to data processing:  data gathering, data cleansing, and data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Gathering\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will stick to just the data professional survey. But if you want to take this further, a few additional data sources could be:\n",
    "\n",
    "* PPP GDP per capita to normalize salaries across countries.\n",
    "* A geocoding data set to visualize results on a map.\n",
    "* Cost of living by ZIP code to normalize salaries within the US.\n",
    "* Census information to build out data by ZIP code.\n",
    "* Data from other surveys to add more to the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are interested in extending this to include PPP GDP per capita, check out [a blog post I did based on the 2017 survey results](https://36chambers.wordpress.com/2017/01/18/analyzing-dba-salaries/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Cleansing\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is where we begin the real work.  In the next snippet, I am going to load a series of libraries in R.  We will use each of them over the course of this notebook.  The `tidyverse` package is a series of incredibly useful libraries in R, and I can't think of doing a data science project in R without it.  The `XLConnect` package lets me read an Excel workbook easily and grab the salary data without much hassle.  The `caret` library provides some helpful tooling for working with data, including splitting out test versus training data, like we'll do below.  The `recipes` package will be useful for normalizing data later, and we will use `data.table` to get a glimpse at some of our uneven data.  We need the `devtools` package to install `keras` from GitHub.  Keras is a deep learning library which implements several neural network libraries, including TensorFlow, which we are using today.  We need to install TensorFlow on our machine.  Because this is a small data set, and because I want this to run on machines without powerful GPUs, I am using the CPU-based version of TensorFlow.  Performance should still be adequate for our purposes."

    "We can use the `setDT` function on `data.table` to see just how many records we have for each level of a particular factor.  For example, we can see the different entries for PrimaryDatabase and EmploymentSector below.  Both of these are troublesome for our modeling because they both have a number of levels with 1-2 entries.  This makes it likely that we will fail to collect a relevant record in our training data set, and that will mess up our model later.  To rectify this, I am going to remove PrimaryDatabase as a feature and remove the two students from our sample."

    "Because our question is a \"how much?\" question, we want to use regression to solve the problem.  The most common form of regression that you'll see in demonstrations is linear regression, because it is easy to teach and easy to understand.  In today's demo, however, we're going to build a neural network with Keras.  Although our demo is in R, Keras actually uses Python on the back end to run TensorFlow.  There are other libraries out there which can run neural networks strictly within R (for example, Microsoft Machine Learning's R implemenation has the `RxNeuralNet()` function), but we will use Keras in this demo because it is a popular library.\n",

I want to use Country as the partition variable because I want to ensure that we retain some data from each country in the test set.  To make this split, I am using the `createDataPartition()` function in `caret`.  I'll then split out the data into training and test data."

We'd need to ask people what their actual salaries are to know for sure, but we could feed these back into the training data and keep training our model.  One of the nice things about using a neural network like this is that we can continuously train the model based on our newly-gathered data.\n",
    "\n",

If they're happy with this result, we could probably look at other uses for the data source, such as cleaning up postal code and integrating with a service to get more granular information on salary in certain parts of larger countries like the US and Canada."
